<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p align="justify"> 
  A stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a deep learning architecture that consists of multiple layers of LSTM units.
</p>
<p align="justify"> 
   In a traditional LSTM, there is a single layer of LSTM units that processes the input sequence. In contrast, a stacked LSTM consists of multiple layers of LSTM units that process the input sequence in a hierarchical manner, with each layer processing the output from the previous layer.

<h2 id="intro">How it works?</h2>
<p align="justify"> 
  1. The output from each layer is passed as input to the next layer, and the final output is obtained from the last layer. .
</p>
<p align="justify"> 
   1. Stacked LSTMs are often used in sequence-to-sequence learning tasks, such as language translation and speech recognition, where long-term dependencies between the input and output sequences need to be captured.

<h2 id="pros">Advantages</h2>

1. <b>One advantage of using a stacked LSTM is that it allows for the modeling of more complex temporal dependencies between the input and output sequences.</b>
2. <b>Each layer can capture different aspects of the input sequence, allowing the network to learn more nuanced representations of the data.</b>
3. <b>Additionally, stacked LSTMs can reduce overfitting, as the multiple layers can act as a form of regularization.</b>

<h2 id="pros">Disadvantages</h2>

1. <b>Using a stacked LSTM is that it can be computationally expensive, as each layer requires additional computation and memory.</b>

<br>

2. <b>Additionally, stacking too many layers can lead to the problem of vanishing gradients, where the gradients become too small to effectively update the weights of the network during training.</b>
